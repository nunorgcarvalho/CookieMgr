//              it deals with the soil
//   soil       the soil rule: a little code of its own that picks the soil (garden.soil(…)), run

//   template   where the seeds go: a 6×6 grid of letters (A, B, C…) or nothing. "Fill" (A on every
//              tile) is every garden of one seed; "Mutation rows" two parents with a row of empty
//              tiles between them. It sits on the unlocked part of the plot from its top-left
//              corner (a smaller garden uses its top-left part); one taken as it is on the plot
//              (abs) stays where it was
//   seeds      which seed each letter is: { A: 'bakerWheat', B: 'thumbcorn' }
//   profile    a combination: { gardener, soil, template, seeds } — loading one picks all four
//

// back) and yours (made with Save as new; renamed, deleted). The "Current garden" template and
