// Payback: what buying something is worth — cookieMgr's own version of Cookie Monster's numbers, so
// nothing needs Cookie Monster loaded. (Grown from the simulator's staging module, sim/mgr/staging;
// the model follows Cookie Monster — MIT — src/Sim and src/Cache/PP.)
//
// **Bonus income** — the CpS a purchase adds, asked of the game itself: make the change (one more
// building, or ten, or an upgrade bought), run the game's own Game.CalculateGains(), read the CpS,
// undo. Exact for any game version, any mod that hooks CpS. Like Cookie Monster, it counts the
// achievements the purchase would win (their milk feeds the kittens): building-count tiers, the
// totals (Builder…, Centennial…, Mathematician, Base 10), upgrade counts (Enhancer…), sets
// (Spooky cookies, Let it snow, O Fortuna, Elder…) and the CpS milestones the new CpS passes
// (CalculateGains awards those itself — here they're won only in the hypothetical, then undone).
// Nothing about the real game changes: amounts, achievements, the highest CpS are put back and the
// CpS recomputed once after a batch.
//
// **Payback period** (PP), Cookie Monster's formula: the time until you can afford it at your CpS,
// plus how long it takes to earn its price back:
//
//     PP = max(price − bank, 0) ÷ CpS + price ÷ bonus income            (bonus ≤ 0 → ∞)
//
// with CpS the game's (buffs included, so a Frenzy shrinks every PP alike) and the bank optionally
// counting what your wrinklers would give back. An upgrade that only makes clicks stronger is worth
// its extra cookies per click × your clicks per second. That's the cps **payback mode**; the others
// count in another income — raw CpS, CpS + clicking, your actual income (see "payback modes"
// below) — and the setting ppMode picks the one everything uses.
//
// **Colors** (Cookie Monster's): blue — better than the best building (only upgrades can be);
// green — the best building; yellow / orange / red — within the 10 / 20 / 30 best building PPs (one,
// ten and a hundred of each count, sixty in all); purple — worse; gray — never pays back.
//
// The expensive part (the bonus incomes — about 90 CpS computations) is kept until the game state
// changes (what's owned, buffs, the store, CpS by more than 0.1%) or a second has passed with CpS drifting; PPs and colors
// are worked out from it on every read, so they follow your bank as it grows.
