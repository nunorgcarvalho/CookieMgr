// v3.7.2: payback measures only what's asked. Buying (best, pp.best, the autobuyers) asks for the
// buildings you can buy at the amount you'd buy and the store's upgrades — not the sixty rows of the
// colour table (every building ×1/×10/×100, locked ones too), which only the store's colours and the
// Payback page need; best() doesn't measure an upgrade whose wait to afford alone is longer than the
// best building's payback period; cookie upgrades that win nothing are worked out (CpS × power%)
// after one is measured as a check; the store redraws from a table up to 2 s old. Same answers.
// (In the real game: tests/sim/payback-perf, and the parity tests against Cookie Monster.)
