# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Stock market indicators:** every stock box in the Bank minigame now shows its trend (Stable, Slow rise, Slow fall,
  Fast rise, Fast fall, Chaotic) as a coloured strip with a symbol, so you don't have to hover. The box is tinted in the
  trend's colour and glows brighter (with a star) while you hold that stock. Both parts can be switched off in Settings.
- **Portfolio value & unrealized gains:** the stock chart on the Graphs tab now defaults to your total portfolio value
  over time plus a cost-basis line, with stat tiles for Value, Unrealized gain, Realized profit and Total gain — instead
  of a wall of individual stock prices you'd have to add up yourself. "Per stock" in the toolbar switches back to the
  old price-lines view. Cost basis is tracked from when the mod loads (buys/sells raise or realize it); it can't know
  about trades made before that.
- **Graph in the Bank minigame:** a small chart now sits right under the stock list in the Bank minigame itself, toggled
  between portfolio value and per-stock prices (same "Sync to owned stocks" setting as the Graphs-tab chart, so buying
  a stock shows it in both places automatically). Can be turned off in Settings.
- **Update check:** CookieMgr now checks GitHub every 15 minutes for a newer build and, if there is one, shows a
  notification with a one-click reload. It never updates itself silently — see the note in src/core/update.js for why.
- **CpS graph is now a stacked bar chart:** each bar is Production (bottom) with Clicking stacked on top, so the total
  bar height is your combined income — replaces the old "with clicking"/"production" line toggles. The Unbuffed CpS
  line is now always on (no longer a toggle) as a dashed reference line over the bars.
  Defaults otherwise: Log scale, 5 minute window, 5 s smoothing. (Your own choices are still remembered from here on.)
- **History survives a page refresh:** the rolling 4-hour CpS/effect record is now mirrored to localStorage every 20s
  (and on page close), separate from the actual game save, so reloading the page doesn't blank the graphs. Stock price
  history and portfolio value/cost-basis history now do the same — cost basis and realized profit carry over too,
  instead of resetting to the current price on every reload.
- **Fewer redundant markers:** a golden/wrath cookie pop no longer gets its own diamond marker when the effect it
  granted is already visible as a shaded band right there — reindeer pops and effect-less pops still show one.
- **Y-axis labels:** the CpS and stock graphs now size their left margin to whatever the numbers actually render as
  (long Numbers-preference names included), instead of clipping wide labels; freed-up space went to the plot itself.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-30

- **Tabs** at the top of the panel: Autoclickers, Graphs, Settings.
- **CpS graph:** live, adjustable window (1 m–3 h), smoothing, log scale, unbuffed / production / with-clicking lines,
  measured click income, pause and clear.
- **Effect shading:** every active buff as a coloured, stackable band with hover details; golden / wrath / reindeer /
  ascension markers.
- History recorder (session-only, rolling 4 h) with a setting to turn it off.
- Repo: CI check, MIT license, Prettier/EditorConfig, `npm run check`, docs and screenshots.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-29

First version as a proper add-on (was a single-line bookmarklet). Renamed from Cookie Agent to CookieMgr.

- Loads through the official mod API; settings saved inside the game save.
- Side tab on the left beam opens the CookieMgr panel in the game's menu area.
- Autoclickers from v0.1: big cookie, golden, wrath, reindeer, fortune news, wrinklers — each with a switch and a
  rebindable hotkey (modifiers supported). Toggle-all hotkey plus All on / All off buttons.
- Settings: turn off autoclickers on ascension, toggle notifications, remember on/off states, panel hotkey.
- Stops the old v0.1 bookmarklet if it is running.

## 0.1

Bookmarklet with hotkeys A / C / G / R / W / F / K (see `legacy/`).
